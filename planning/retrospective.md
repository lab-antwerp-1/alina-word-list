# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

-Function refactor.
-Write user story.

## Continue Doing

-Document functions and README.md.

## Start Doing

- rewrite functions.

## Lessons Learned

function roles: 
  -Learned how to use them in a program. You can split your projects into smaller, more specific tasks making it easier to collaborate.
  -Components are functions that return a _component_ of the user interface. In this project a component is just a function that returns a DOM element.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

-Function refactor:
  In this project. I mainly focus on the workflow fo develop an application. I want to save time so I copied js demo code from Evan. I did function refactor and changed variable name. 

-Part of the project workflow:
  Set repo -> create issue -> plan  -> dev.

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

-I didn't plan files in /doc. It turns out documentation is important and necessary. 

-Development strategy. It's not clear. But how to improve step by step? I have no idea.

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

### Or remove extra steps?
