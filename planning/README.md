# README

This is an individual project to practice working on a full HTML/CSS/JS website. The project is to build an app in witch user can add words to a list and sort the list with 6 options.

## Constraints

Constraints help to scoping this project and clear about what it isn't.

## Backlog

Backlog is a list of User Stories sorted by priority. 
  - Must Have: these user stories are necessary for basic usability.
  - Should Have: these user stories will complete the user experience, but are not necessary.
  - Could Have: these user stories would be really cool ... if there's time.
  
## Development Strategy

I translates must-have User Stories and my design into specific coding tasks in Development Strategy.

## Retrospective

A retrospective is meant for looking back at how the project went and learning what to do differently next time. An incomplete project with a great retrospective is still a success.
