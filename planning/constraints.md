# Constraints

Some boundaries around project.

## External

constraints coming from the outside that I have no control over.

  - project deadline: 20.02.2022

## Internal: Involuntary

constraints that come from me, and I have no control over.

  - individual skill levels: basic level of html, css and js.
  - amount of time available to work on the project: 1.5 h/day. Because I need to learn "separation-of-concerns" at the same time.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
